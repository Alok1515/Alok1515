I'm Alok, a software engineer and I'm currently in my 3rd year.

I build whatever i can imagine.

My main tech stack is tailwind, react, typescript, express, nextjs and mongodb for the databases.

I've got a bunch of project which uses AI and those are very useful in day to day life.

The current project which I'm working on is Carbon track which can be used to overcome the carbon emission.
